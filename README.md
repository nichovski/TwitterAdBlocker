The Chrome extension "Twitter ad blocker" is a simple tool designed to remove promoted tweets from your Twitter feed. Promoted tweets are advertisements that appear in your Twitter timeline, interspersed with regular tweets from the people and organizations you follow. The "Twitter ad blocker" extension helps to clean up your Twitter feed by removing these ads, making it easier for you to focus on the content that you actually want to see.

The extension works by using JavaScript to manipulate the HTML and CSS of the Twitter page. When the page loads, the extension's code runs in the background and searches for elements with the text "Promoted." When it finds these elements, it removes their parent container, effectively hiding the promoted tweet. The extension also adds a scroll event listener to the page, so that it will re-run its code whenever you scroll through your Twitter feed. This ensures that new promoted tweets that are loaded as you scroll down the page will also be automatically removed.

The extension's code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses modern JavaScript features like arrow functions and destructuring assignment to keep the code concise and readable. The extension's manifest file is also simple, specifying that the extension should run on the main Twitter page, and that it requires permission to access this page.

In conclusion, the "Twitter ad blocker" Chrome extension is a small but effective tool for improving your Twitter experience. If you're tired of seeing ads in your Twitter feed, this extension can help you clean up your timeline and focus on the content that you actually want to see. With its straightforward code and easy-to-understand manifest file, this extension is a great choice for anyone looking to make their Twitter experience a little bit better.
